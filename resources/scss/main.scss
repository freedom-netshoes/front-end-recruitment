// We are following a pattern called ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS).
// The concept is based mainly around layering on styles based on their reach within
// the DOM. We are also using this in combination of BEM and name spacing.

// Settings: Global variables, config and  colors definitions.
@import "settings/colors",
		"settings/global",
		"settings/fonts",
		"settings/screens",
		"settings/easing";

// Tools: Libraries, mixins and functions.
@import "tools/mixins";
@import "tools/flexboxgrid";

// Generic: Ground-zero styles (normalize, reset, box-sizing).
@import "generic/normalize",
		"generic/helpers";

// Elements: Unclassed HTML elements (type selectors).
@import "elements/headings",
		"elements/paragraphs",
		"elements/lists",
		"elements/links";

// Objects: Class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns.
@import "objects/header",
		"objects/sidebar",
		"objects/footer",
		"objects/layout";

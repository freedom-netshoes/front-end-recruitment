# Front end Recruitment Test

## Why components/services as folder structure?
I believe that a component should be self-contained, each component,
scene or service (a feature) must have everything it needs to work on its own,
such as its own styles, images, translations, set of actions as well as 
unit tests. I learned that this pattern help my projects to be
both scalable and reusable.
